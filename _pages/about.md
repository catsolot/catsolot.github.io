I am first-year graduate student at Virginia Tech studying safe kernel extensions, primarily focusing on extending eBPF through new kernel mechanisms.
[eBPF](https://ebpf.io/) provides a mechanism to safely extend running kernels, providing a unique way to dynamically change operating system behavior.
eBPF has been applied to increase system observability and tracing, as well as to improve networking performance by bypassing the existing kernel networking
stack.

I have been an avid Linux user and enthusiast since my older brother installed Arch Linux on my laptop in elementary school.
Currently, I am the President of the [Linux and Unix Users Group at Virginia Tech](https://vtluug.org).
I believe that high quality free and open source software is absolutely essential to the modern tech landscape, and, as an extension, modern society.

Outside of technology, I am an avid musician, and I love spending time outdoors.
I enjoy reading books, and going deep on topics that interest me, which is the focus of the blog attached to this page.
